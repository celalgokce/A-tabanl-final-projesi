                of the group, Barney Stinson, is a one-of-a-kind, suit-wearing womanizer. When Marshall tells 
                Ted he's going to propose to Lily, Ted realizes he doesn’t want to remain single and believes 
                he'll find his true love. Just then, he meets Robin Scherbatsky, completing the tight-knit group 
                of How I Met Your Mother.

                sitcoms of recent times due to its time-jumping narrative, reflections of characters in daily 
                life, and perspectives on male-female relationships.
